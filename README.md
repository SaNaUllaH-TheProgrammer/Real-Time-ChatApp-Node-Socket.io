**How to run:**    
• The chatApp.zip contains two subfolders: nodemodules which are the dependencies required for the project and the public folder which has the style sheet of the project and the client-side code.  
• To run the code, first open the visual studio code or any other compiler and load the zip folder inside the workspace of compiler.  
• Install the dependencies for the project by using following commands in sequence in the terminal of the compiler (make sure that node runtime is installed in your machine):  
o npm install socket.io  
o npm install express  
• After the following commands, you are set to run the project. Type “node server.js” in the terminal and press enter.
